In this repository, I will list all of the things that I did during my internship at CODESOFT

Task 1 involves a number game. In this game, a random number between 1 and 100 is chosen. The user is then asked to guess this number. The user has 10 attempts to guess correctly. After each guess, the program will inform the user whether the chosen number is higher or lower than their guess.

Task 2 involves a student-grade program. This program prompts the user to input their name and the grades theyâ€™ve received in 10 specific subjects. The program then generates a table that includes the subjects, the corresponding grades, as well as the average grade. The program also assigns a grade based on the specified criteria.

Task 3 involves a simulation of an ATM machine. The program took a 4-character code from the user and displayed the amount the user had in their bank account. The user could also deposit and withdraw money.
